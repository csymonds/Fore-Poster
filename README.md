# Fore-Poster

A social media automation tool designed for technical content creators. Schedule and manage posts across platforms with a focus on technical education content.

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Setup Script
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd fore-poster

# Run the setup script
./setup.sh
```

The setup script will:
- Create a virtual environment if needed
- Set up the .env file from .env.example if none exists
- Ensure the environment configuration is correctly linked
- Offer to install dependencies for both backend and frontend
- Make development testing scripts executable

### 2. Start the Application

#### Option 1: Using Dev Scripts (Recommended)
```bash
# Start the backend (in one terminal)
./dev_backend.sh

# Start the frontend (in another terminal)
./dev_frontend.sh
```

The dev scripts provide:
- Automatic database reset with the backend script
- Option to start the scheduler alongside the backend
- Proper environment linking verification
- Better logging and error handling

#### Option 2: Manual Startup
```bash
# Reset and initialize the database with admin user
python backend/reset_db.py

# Start the Flask API server
python backend/run.py

# Start development server (in a new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Access the Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000/api

## Features
- Post scheduling and management
- Multi-platform support (currently X/Twitter)
- Development/Production environment handling
- AWS SES integration for notifications
- Secure authentication with JWT
- Background job processing

## Environment Setup

The project uses a single `.env` file in the root directory for all environment variables. This keeps configuration in one place and avoids duplication.

For frontend access, a symbolic link is created from `frontend/.env` to the root `.env` file. This ensures that:
1. Vite can find environment variables in the expected location
2. Only variables with the `VITE_` prefix are exposed to the frontend code
3. Changes to the root `.env` file are immediately reflected in the frontend

The `setup.sh` script ensures this link is correctly created and maintained.

### Database
- Development: SQLite database in `backend/instance/fore_poster.db`
- Production: PostgreSQL database (configured via environment variables)

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Default admin user created from ADMIN_USERNAME and ADMIN_PASSWORD in .env

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
If you encounter database errors, try resetting the database:
```bash
python backend/reset_db.py
```

### Environment Variable Issues
If your environment variables aren't being picked up correctly:
1. Check that the `.env` file exists in the project root
2. Verify that `frontend/.env` is a symbolic link to `../.env`
3. Run `./setup.sh` to fix any environment issues
